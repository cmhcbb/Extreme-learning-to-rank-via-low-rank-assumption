syntest3ver.jl is the main function of the synthetic data.  
testtest.jl is the main function of using the 5 ratings to do both training and prediction among 100 users.  
realdata.jl is the main function of using the all pairs among 100 users. And it needs to the A matrix to be in the folder.
acctest.jl is the function to measure the number of right count and total count.
gentest.jl is the function to get the testset.
ours3ver.jl is the alternating gradient descent function for the real data.
parindex.jl is to the function to get the exact index for each users. For example, 
            user     movies    rating
            1         5         2.5
            1         3         3
            2         4         3
            2         10        4
            
            so parindex will return [0,2,4]
ranksvm.jl is the function using ranksvm algorithm.

The program needs to use MAT package. So add the MAT package first which is Pkg.add("MAT")

There are two ways to run a program:
1. julia [file_name]
2. julia 
   entring into the julia command line.
   julia>>  include("[filename]")
